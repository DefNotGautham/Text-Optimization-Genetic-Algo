## V1(02.05.20) : Single Point Crossover(Max population size:100, Mutation Rate:1%)
* Mutation rate was optimal at 1%-1.5%, overmutation at 2%
* Occational failure to find optimal evolution , segment based evolution recommended
* Compute time showed random variance suspected reason being the choice of Single Point Crossover.
